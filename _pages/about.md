### About me

I am a junior student majoring in **computer science** at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](www.sjtu.edu.cn) (SJTU). I am a member of [ACM Honors Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), which is an elite CS program for top 5% talented students at SJTU. And I am among the top 3 students of the class.

I plan to pursue a CS Ph.D. program that starts in fall 2020.

### Research interest
I am interested in computer architecture and deep learning.

### Research Experience

#### [HanLab](https://songhan.mit.edu), MIT

I am an research assistant supervised by Prof. Song Han in HanLab, MIT, from Jul. 2019 to present.
* Focusing on privacy preserving and efficient machine learning.
* Won first place in the CVPR'19 Visual Wake Words challenge and third place (academic first place) in CVPR'19 Low Power Image Recognition Competition track 1.

#### [SpeechLab](https://speechlab.sjtu.edu.cn/), SJTU
I am an undergraduate researcher advised by Prof. Yanmin Qian and Prof. Kai Yu in SpeechLab, SJTU, from Jul. 2018 to present.
* Focused on Rich Audio Analysis (RAA), analysis and classification of non-text information with human speech.
* Designed a data augmentation using variational autoencoder for embedding based speaker verification, [Interspeech 2019 oral](assets/VAE_Data_Augmentation_proceeding.pdf).
* Implemented a deep coanonical correlation analysis (DCCA) to combine *i*-vector and *x*-vector, which are two kinds of highly complementary embedding of speaker.

### Teaching Experience 
* [Compiler Design and Implementation](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/wiki/Compiler_2019), teacher assistant, Spring 2019
* [C++ Programing (CS512)](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/wiki/Programming_2017), teacher assistant, Fall 2017
