I am a senior student majoring in computer science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University ([SJTU](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/)) and a member of the SJTU ACM Honors Class, which is an elite CS program for the top 5% talented students. 

**My overall GPA is 92.47/100, Rank: 2/37**.

I have spent wonderful times as a research assistant working with Prof. [Song Han](https://songhan.mit.edu) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology ([MIT](https://mit.edu)).

I am interested in **efficient deep learning**, especially for **natural language processing** and **speech**, and **computer architecture**.

I am applying for a CS Ph.D. program that starts in the fall, 2020.
