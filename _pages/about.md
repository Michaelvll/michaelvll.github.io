I am a senior student majoring in **computer science** at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn). I am a member of ACM Honors Class, which is an elite CS program for top 5% talented students. **My overall GPA is 92.13/100, Rank: 2/37**.

Currently, I am a **visiting student** at MIT, working with Prof. [Song Han](https://songhan.mit.edu).

I am interested in **deep learning**, especially **natural language processing**, **speech** and **efficient AI**.
And I plan to pursue a CS Ph.D. that starts in fall, 2020.

### Research Experience

#### [HanLab](https://songhan.mit.edu), MIT

I am a research assistant supervised by Prof. Song Han at HanLab, MIT, from Jul. 2019 to present.
* Focusing on privacy preserving and efficient machine learning.
* Working on efficient natural language processing, especially for machine translation. Proposed a novel primitive with higher capacity than the original transformer under mobile settings and submitted to ICLR 2020.
* Designed an efficient privacy-preserving cloud-edge inference method utilizing the linearity of neural networks.
* Won first place in the CVPR’19 Visual Wake Words challenge and third place (first place of all academic groups) in CVPR’19 Low Power Image Recognition Competition.

#### [SpeechLab](https://speechlab.sjtu.edu.cn/), SJTU
I am an undergraduate researcher advised by Prof. Yanmin Qian and Prof. Kai Yu in SpeechLab, SJTU, from Jul. 2018 to present.
* Focused on Rich Audio Analysis (RAA), analysis and classification of non-text information within human speech.
* Implemented Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA) in pytorch and released the code on GitHub.
* Participated in the translation of the book: Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Sutton, R.S., Barto, A.G.
* Established a VAE based data augmentation to improve the robustness of speaker verification systems by modelling the patterns of noise and reverberation in the speaker embeddings. It was accepted by Interspeech 2019 (oral).
