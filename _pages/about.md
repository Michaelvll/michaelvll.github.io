I am a senior student majoring in **computer science** at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn). I am a member of the ACM Honors Class, which is an elite CS program for the top 5% talented students. 

**My overall GPA is 92.47/100, Rank: 2/37**.

Currently, I am a **visiting student** at MIT, working with Prof. [Song Han](https://songhan.mit.edu).

I am interested in **efficient deep learning**, especially for **natural language processing** and **speech**, and **computer architecture**.

I plan to pursue a CS Ph.D. that starts in the fall, 2020.

#### [**HanLab**](https://songhan.mit.edu), MIT

Research assistant, working with Prof. [Song Han](https://songhan.mit.edu) at HanLab, MIT, from Jul. 2019 to present.
* Worked on privacy-preserving and efficient machine learning. Designed a privacy-preserving cloud-edge inference method utilizing the linearity of neural networks. Wrote a paper and submitted it to **CVPR** 2019.
* Devoted to efficient natural language processing, especially for machine translation. Proposed a novel primitive with higher capacity than the original transformer under mobile settings. Wrote a paper and submitted it to **ICLR** 2020. The paper just received very positive reviews (Average score: **6.7/8**).
* Focused on the hardware-aware transformer. Automatically designed neural architectures specialized for different hardware with better tradeoff between latency and BLEU score. Prepared a paper for **ACL** 2020.
* Won **1st** place in the CVPR'19 Visual Wake Words Challenge and **3rd place** (**1st** place of all academic groups) in CVPR'19 Low Power Image Recognition Challenge.

#### [**SpeechLab**](https://speechlab.sjtu.edu.cn/), SJTU

Undergraduate researcher, advised by Prof. [Yanmin Qian](https://speechlab.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yanmin_qian) and Prof. [Kai Yu](https://speechlab.sjtu.edu.cn/members/kai_yu) at SpeechLab, SJTU, from Jul. 2018 to Jun. 2019.
* Focused on Rich Audio Analysis (RAA), analysis, and classification of non-text information within speech.
* Implemented Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA) in PyTorch and released the code on GitHub.
* Deep Learning Book Translation: Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Sutton, R.S., Barto, A.G.
* Established a VAE based data augmentation to improve the robustness of speaker verification systems by modeling the patterns of noise and reverberation in the speaker embeddings. It was accepted by **Interspeech** 2019 **(oral)**.

### Honors & Award
* **1st place**, in Visual Wake Words (VWW) Challenge of CVPR'19, 2019.
* **3rd place**, in Low Power Image Recognition Challenge of CVPR'19 (1st place of academic groups), 2019.
* **Outstanding Winner**,in Mathematical Contest in Modeling (top 0.5%), 2017.
* **Chinese National Scholarship**, highest honor for undergraduates, top 0.2% nation wide, 2018 & 2019.
* **Fan Hsu-Chi Chancellorâ€™s Scholarship**, top 0.1%of 17,000 students in SJTU, 2017.
* **Zhiyuan Honorary Scholarship**, top 5%of 17,000 students in SJTU, 2016-2018.
