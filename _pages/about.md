I fortunately joined the CS Ph.D. program at [UC Berkeley Sky Computing Lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/) in the fall, 2020. I am currently working with Prof. [Ion Stoica](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/) on efficient deep learning and system. 

Before coming to Berkeley, I was an undergraduate student majoring in computer science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University ([SJTU](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/)) and a member of the SJTU ACM Honors Class.

I also had a wonderful time as a research assistant working with [Prof. Song Han](https://songhan.mit.edu) at MIT HAN Lab, and an undergraduate researcher working with [Prof. Kai Yu](https://speechlab.sjtu.edu.cn/members/kai_yu) and [Prof. Yanmin Qian](https://speechlab.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yanmin_qian) at SJTU SpeechLab.

<!-- My research interests lie in **efficient deep learning**, especially for **natural language processing** and **speech**, and **system**. -->
