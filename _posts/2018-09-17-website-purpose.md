Hi, this is my first post. Excited! And I would like to talk about what's the purpose of this website. As far as I am concerned, this website would be a personal website recording some of my [researches](/tags/#research), [notes](/tags/#note) and [thoughts](/tags/#thought).

### Research

In research tag, there will be some posts about what research I have done.

### Note

In note tag, there will be some notes taken when I reads some papers and some ideas I come up with. As I prefer taking notes by OneNote, the notes here may only contain part of my notes.

### Thought

In thought tag, there will be some of my thoughts about life, maybe some feelings for a movie or a book.

That's all of what I can consider currently. And I may add some more tags in the future (who knows?).
