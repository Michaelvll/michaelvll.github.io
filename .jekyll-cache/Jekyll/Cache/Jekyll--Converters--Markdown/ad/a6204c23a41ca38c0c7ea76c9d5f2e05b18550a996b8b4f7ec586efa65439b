I"ç<p>Hi, this is my first post. Excited! And I would like to talk about what‚Äôs the purpose of this website. As far as I am concerned, this website would be a personal website recording some of my <a href="/tags/#research">researches</a>, <a href="/tags/#note">notes</a> and <a href="/tags/#thought">thoughts</a>.</p>

<h3 id="research">Research</h3>

<p>In research tag, there will be some posts about what research I have done.</p>

<h3 id="note">Note</h3>

<p>In note tag, there will be some notes taken when I reads some papers and some ideas I come up with. As I prefer taking notes by OneNote, the notes here may only contain part of my notes.</p>

<h3 id="thought">Thought</h3>

<p>In thought tag, there will be some of my thoughts about life, maybe some feelings for a movie or a book.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs all of what I can consider currently. And I may add some more tags in the future (who knows?).</p>
